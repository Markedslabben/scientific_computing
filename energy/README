**************************************      Task1      **************************************

# Python isn't very efficient when it has to go through many for loops for computation.
 Purpose of this task is to speed up the computations by rewriting some functions from Python in C/C++

# We provide a test script main.py which performs the operation:
								1) reading data from files (uses functions readFiles.py)
								2) Performing enegy computation (uses functions in pyFunctions.py)

 Data files: dataFile, PC.pws

 The same energy computation functions in c are provided in: cFunction.c
 

# Outcome: A test script to demonstrate C function integrated into the python script with a speed-up using profiling tools.

Additional info:
# If you use ctypes - you will need to share the commands used to compile a static/dynamic library of the C functions 
# If there are recommendations for speeding up the file read 



**************************************      Task2      **************************************

# The data (each line) in dataFile may not be unique but repeating
# That is only n unique lines (data)  from a total of N lines 

# Outcome: Return two lists:
				1) location of the 'n' unique lines 
				2) of all N points: pointing to the first unique data from n
